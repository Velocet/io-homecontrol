          # Configure how strict the tool is about which checks are considered errors vs warnings if they don't pass.
          # strict - enforces best practices, above and beyond the minimum requirements for specification compliance. Use this setting to ensure the best experience for the users of the project.
          # specification - enforces compliance with the official Arduino project specifications.
          # permissive - will cause the checks to fail only when severe problems are found. Although a project that passes at the permissive setting will work with the current Arduino development software versions, it may not be fully specification-compliant, risking incompatibility or a poor experience for the users.
